### ðŸš€ What does this PR do?
- Adds a **C++ implementation** of **Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree**.  
- Traverses the binary tree and groups all nodes in the same vertical column together.  
- Uses **BFS traversal** with position tracking to handle vertical and level ordering.  
- Includes a detailed `README.md` file explaining:
  - Problem statement  
  - Approach and complexity analysis  
  - Example input/output  
  - Complete and beginner-friendly C++ code

### ðŸ§¾ Problem Reference
**Topic:** Binary Tree Traversal  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Category:** Tree, BFS, Sorting, Data Structures  

---

### ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights
- Implements **Vertical Order Traversal** using a combination of **maps, queues, and multisets**.  
- Keeps track of both **vertical (x)** and **level (y)** positions of nodes.  
- Nodes at the same position are sorted automatically using a **multiset**.  
- Provides clean and structured traversal logic with a **BFS-based approach**.  
- Optimized and easy-to-understand C++ solution suitable for **beginners** and **interview preparation**.  
- Accompanied by a detailed and formatted `README.md` for conceptual clarity.
